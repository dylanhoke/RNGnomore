This project will be focused on defeating RNG in any environment.
Pesky RNG is a thing of the past and is not rewarding or even appealing
to any fanbase. I know for a fact that I have stopped playing videogames
in the past due to my time not being respected or valued.

The goal of this program will be to develop a merit based micro RNG system
that allows players to progressively build upon their skills, talents and
interests and allows them to play the game the way they want to play it.

In this repository we will discuss a number of things.
The name RNGNomore or (R.N.G No More) is not simply a program to fix RNG
it proposes a variety of ideas and concepts that avid gamers and no lifers
have been complaining about for a long while now, we will discuss, attributes,
skills, talents, LOOT, crafting, specialized talents, progression, skill based
questlines, hidden content, achievements, interactions with other players,
and Combat.
