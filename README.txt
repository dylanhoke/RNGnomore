This project will be focused on defeating RNG in any environment.
Pesky RNG is a thing of the past and is not rewarding or even appealing
to any fanbase. I know for a fact that I have stopped playing videogames
in the past due to my time not being respected or valued.

The goal of this program will be to develop a merit based micro RNG system
that allows players to progressively build upon their skills, talents and
interests and allows them to play the game the way they want to play it.
